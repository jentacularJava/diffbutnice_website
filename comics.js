    caption: '',
    alt: 'Single-panel comic. A tired-looking child sits in a stroller with a sunshade, eyes half-closed, while an adult with black hair jogs and pushes the stroller fast—speed lines trail behind them. The adult leans forward, shouting to keep the child awake: “DON’T YOU DARE FALL ASLEEP! HEY! HEY! LA LA LA LA!! BOO! BAH! WAKE UP!” The child remains drowsy and unimpressed. Signature at bottom reads “diffbutnice.”'

Panel 2: In the top-right square, bold handwritten text reads “Grilled Cheese Sandwich,” implying the rejected option. Panel 3: In the bottom-left square, the same figure smiles with eyes closed and gives a thumbs-up while facing forward, approvingly. Panel 4: In the bottom-right square, bold handwritten text reads “Boogers,” indicating the preferred option. The comic parodies the two-panel preference meme format for humorous contrast.'

    alt: 'Single-panel comic. A mom with short dark hair and pink glasses sits in bed reading to two kids. Their shirts are labeled with ages: the child on the left says “3,” the child on the right says “5,” and the mom’s shirt says “mom.” Above them, narration text reads: “...THE WOLF CAME TO A SIGN. DOES HE GO TO THE WITCH OR THE DONUTS?” The 5-year-old, grinning and gesturing, interrupts with, “SMASH ‘LIKE’ FOR THE WITCH. SUBSCRIBE FOR THE DONUTS.” The mom looks mildly startled. Signature in the corner reads “diffButNice.” The joke is the kid turning a choose-your-own-adventure story into social-media engagement choices.'

On the right, a parent labeled “mom” sits buckled in, wearing glasses and a neutral expression. Large overlapping speech bubbles fill the top. From the parent: “ARE YOU OK?” and then “DO YOU FEEL SICK?” From the child: “YES.” and then “NO. I’M JUST IMPATIENT.” The humor comes from the dramatic concern contrasted with the child’s blunt explanation of impatience during the car ride. Signature on the right edge reads “diffBettNice.”'

Beside the ladder stands a man labeled 'DAD,' looking up silently. The artist credit 'diffButNice' appears on the sign’s lower right edge. The joke is the workplace-style safety sign adapted for parenting, celebrating a short streak without yelling."

Above the child, a wavy speech bubble reads, “WAAH! I DROPPED MY HAT!” Center foreground: a baseball cap lies on the floor. Right: An adult labeled “mom” on her shirt bends over to pick up the hat. She wears pink glasses and has straight black hair. Her speech bubble starts, “I CAN HELP YOU GRAB—” but is interrupted by a smaller burst from the child that censors a swear, “F***!” The joke is that the child thinks the adult is about to say the censored word, cutting her off mid-sentence.'

Far right: Three sturdy flowers labeled 'Dandelions' stand upright with jagged leaves. Bottom text, highlighted in yellow: 'PLANTS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS. THIS ISN'T ABOUT PLANTS.' The visual metaphor contrasts the wilted rose and resilient dandelions to suggest that different children need different parenting approaches."

A small child wearing a shirt with the number 5 sits up on the bed and calls out, “Dada!” Panel 2: Same scene, now quiet; from off-panel a jagged speech line indicates a sleepy response, “What?” The child sits waiting. Panel 3: The child leans forward, earnest, saying, “I have to tell you something.” Panel 4: A door cracks open with an adult peeking in from the hallway. The child smiles and announces, “Tell Mom I have the hiccups.” The humor comes from waking a parent just to relay the trivial hiccup news via the other parent.'

That was episode zero.” The punchline emphasizes the child’s clever rule-stretching.'

Panel 4: The background still repeats “I WANT TOAST.” The adult, now frazzled, clutches a stack of bread and yells, “I’M LITERALLY DOING THIS AS FAST AS I CAN.” The joke centers on the child’s relentless repetition versus the slow reality of making toast.'

The child, now frowning with effort, gestures toward the covered object and answers loudly: “It’s a blanket.” The adult looks unimpressed, raising an eyebrow.

One mom has straight dark hair and red glasses; the other has shoulder-length hair. In front of them, two happy kids play—one child with pigtails stands with arms up, and another child in an orange shirt kicks a pink-and-purple striped ball. The scene suggests relaxed conversation while kids entertain themselves. Panel 2 (bottom, labeled 'REALITY'): Chaos replaces calm. On the left, one child crouches and eats something off the ground labeled 'floor candy.' Next to her, the second mom clutches her head and yells, shown by a jagged speech bubble saying 'AND THEN—NO!' On the right, the glasses-wearing mom holds a flailing child mid-tantrum while shouting to her friend, 'TELL ME LATER.' The contrast highlights how parenting interrupts attempts at adult conversation."

Panel 2: On the right, another stick-figure woman with straight black hair and red glasses grins with arms open. Handwritten text above her reads, “My faves are ∅, undefined, null, NaN…” She lists programming and math ‘falsy’ values.

Panel 4: Close-up of the phone screen labeled “News Feed.” Two entries appear: at 9:30am, “Bowel movement,” and at 8:30am, “Morning Snack — ate most applesauce.” The joke is the parent’s tender reaction to a very mundane daycare report.'

Two stacked speech bubbles come from them: 'I'm going to say thank you to myself.' and, in a separate bubble, 'Thank you.' Signature in the bottom-right corner reads 'diffButNice.'

I’ll try to—” Left: “Or teething.” Right: “Oh. Um—” Left: “Or growth spurt.” At the very top, a large thought-like line from the right character asks, “Why won’t he sleep?” The bottom-right corner is signed “diffButNice.” The humor comes from the barrage of conflicting baby-sleep explanations overwhelming the exhausted parent.'

Panel 2: Title text reads “Baby #2: Partner texts me while at baby’s dr appointment.” A text bubble from a smiling face icon asks, “Does he say 20 words?” Replies appear as stacked message bubbles from a small avatar of the narrator: “Uh… mama, dada, bear paw, roar, up, more, poo, ball, boot, book…” Next bubble: “maybe not 20?” Final bubble adds more words: “nap, no, bird.” The humor comes from the contrast between meticulous tracking for the first baby and the uncertain, off-the-cuff recall for the second.'
