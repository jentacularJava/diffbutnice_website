  title: Always Setting Timers
- alt_text: 'Panel 1 (top left, labeled 6:30): A simple stick-figure baby with orange hair lies on its back, swaddled, tiny arms bent up, neutral face. Panel 2 (top middle, 6:35): The baby has rolled slightly to its side, still swaddled, eyes half-open. Panel 3 (top right, 6:40): The baby turns further, head at the top right corner, one arm out, looking unsettled. Panel 4 (bottom left, 6:45): The baby rolls so its head is mostly out of frame at the top left, body tilted, arms tucked in. Panel 5 (bottom middle, 6:50): Now upside down in the frame, the baby’s head at the bottom, legs and arms askew as if mid-wiggle. Panel 6 (bottom right, 6:55): The baby has rotated again, head left, mouth open like a sigh, arms raised, still wrapped. The sequence shows the baby repeatedly squirming and rotating in short intervals, conveying restless pre-bedtime movement.'

  title: Restless Baby Timeline
- alt_text: 'Single-panel comic: A simple black-and-white drawing shows a small child standing between a stack of toy blocks on the left and a tiny toy car on the right. Two large speech bubbles float above, presumably from offscreen adults: “Should we do P-A-R-K after N-A-P?” and “Don’t forget S-N-A-C-K.” The child looks up, arms slightly out, with their own speech bubble: “What are you talking about?” Signature in the corner reads “diffbutnice.” The joke is that the adults spell words to hide plans, but the child is confused.'

  title: Spelling Around Kids
- alt_text: Single panel comic. A toddler stands inside a crib, pointing and talking excitedly while a tired parent stands beside the crib with one hand resting on the rail. The toddler says, “Ooh, a spider in my crib. There’s a mouse. Look! A ghost!” The parent replies flatly, “Uh huh. OK, bud.” A thought bubble above the parent reads, “Please stop talking.” Minimal line art; the scene suggests the child is inventing spooky distractions to delay sleep. The artist’s handle “@difffbatnice” appears at the bottom.

  title: Bedtime stall tactics
- alt_text: 'Panel 1: A simple two-panel comic. On the left, a smiling person with short hair gestures reassuringly toward a tired-looking parent with straight black hair and red under-eye lines who is holding a small crying baby with reddish hair. The smiling person says, “It will be so much easier once they can tell you what they want.” The exhausted parent stares blankly. Panel 2: The child is now a little older, standing beside the same tired parent who holds a cup. The child, grinning and insistent, says, “I want milk!” The parent answers, “Here’s milk.” The child immediately says, “I want water!” The parent replies, “Here’s water.” The child yells, “No! Milk! I don’t want water!” The parent looks even more worn out. Small signature at bottom: “diffbutnice.”'

  title: Toddler Demands
- alt_text: 'Single-panel comic. A simple line-drawn bedroom scene with a tall bed at right and a small pillow near the headboard. A parent with straight dark hair stands at left, smiling gently and gesturing with one hand. A child with short reddish hair sits on the edge of the bed, feet dangling, smiling with arms slightly raised. Dialogue floats above them. Parent: ''IT''S TIME TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS. DO YOU WANT TO DO IT, OR MOMMY?'' The child replies: ''OR NO ONE.'' The humor comes from the child''s third option to avoid turning off the lights. Signature at bottom reads ''diffbutnice.'''

  title: Bedtime Negotiation
- alt_text: 'Panel 1: A mock Google page shows a search bar with the query ''toddler always says no.'' Panel 2: Large handwritten text reads, ''Tip #1: Give your child only two options.'' A small Instagram handle ''@diffbutnice'' and the date ''12-11-2020'' appear at the bottom. Panel 3: A smiling parent holds up two socks—one red in the left hand and one blue in the right—and asks, ''Would you like RED socks or BLUE socks?'' A toddler, drawn mid-tantrum with an angry face, arms out, and toys scattered on the floor, screams in a speech bubble, ''NOOOOOO!'' The joke is that even with two choices, the toddler still refuses.'

  title: Two-Option Parenting
- alt_text: 'Single-panel comic. At the top, handwritten narration reads: ''drop slowly forms'' star, ''drop disappears'' star, ''DID THAT GO IN HIS MOUTH?'' ''tries again'' star, ''2 drops quickly into mouth'' star. Below, a Google search bar shows the query: ''can you overdose on vitamin d''. At the bottom, a simple line drawing shows a tired-looking parent with long dark hair holding a small dropper over a squirming baby on a changing table. The parent stares anxiously at the baby’s mouth while administering drops. The humor comes from the parent’s uncertainty about whether the first drop went in, overcompensating with two more, and immediately googling the safety of vitamin D dosage.'

- alt_text: 'Single-panel comic. A tired-looking person stands beside a bed, lifting a pillow with one hand and touching their cheek with the other in surprise. Under the raised pillow is a big red push button on the mattress. A thought bubble above their head reads, ''THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH...'' Handwritten alt_text below: ''Peter discovers the "wake baby" button hidden under his pillow.'' Signature in the corner: ''difflutnice.'' The joke implies the button is what makes their baby wake up whenever the parent lies down.'
